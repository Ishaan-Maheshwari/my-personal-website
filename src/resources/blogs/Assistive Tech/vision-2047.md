# Vision 2047 for Assistive Technology in India

<br/>

## Introduction

As India approaches the centenary of its independence in 2047, it envisions a future where technology acts as a powerful equalizer—ensuring dignity, independence, and full participation for persons with disabilities (PwDs). Assistive Technology (AT) stands at the forefront of this transformative agenda.

**Vision 2047** for Assistive Technology in India aims to create an inclusive, accessible, and empowered society where no individual is left behind due to physical, sensory, cognitive, or communication barriers.

## Current Landscape of Assistive Technology in India

India is home to over **26.8 million** persons with disabilities (Census 2011), and this number is projected to grow with aging and chronic health conditions. Despite this, only a small percentage of PwDs have access to adequate assistive devices and services.

Key challenges include:
- **Limited awareness** and access in rural and semi-urban areas
- **High cost** and import dependence of advanced AT solutions
- **Fragmented supply chains**
- **Lack of standardization and skilled personnel**

## Vision 2047: Key Pillars
<br/>

### 1. **Universal Access to Assistive Technology**

By 2047, every person with a disability in India should have timely access to quality and affordable assistive technology.

- **AT for All**: Nationwide screening and provisioning programs integrated into primary health care.
- **Rural Inclusion**: Mobile AT units and rural outreach programs.
- **Subsidy & Insurance**: Inclusion of AT devices in Ayushman Bharat and private insurance.
<br/>

### 2. **Indigenization and Innovation**

India aims to become a **global leader in AT innovation**, reducing import dependency and fostering home-grown solutions.

- **Make in India for AT**: Boost R&D through public-private partnerships.
- **AI & IoT-Enabled Solutions**: Smart canes, eye-tracking devices, brain-computer interfaces, and more.
- **University-Led Innovation Hubs**: Encourage student entrepreneurship in AT design.
<br/>

### 3. **Inclusive Education & Skill Development**

Technology as a bridge to quality education and employment.

- **Digital Learning Tools**: Inclusive EdTech platforms with text-to-speech, captioning, and gesture support.
- **Accessible Skill Portals**: Vocational training for PwDs using immersive tech like VR/AR.
- **AT in Classrooms**: Equipping schools with AT infrastructure.
<br/>

### 4. **Policy, Standards, and Ecosystem Support**

Strong governance to drive AT deployment and innovation.

- **National Assistive Technology Policy**: A comprehensive legal and operational framework.
- **Standardization**: BIS and global alignment of product quality.
- **National AT Mission**: Like the Digital India and Skill India missions.
<br/>

### 5. **Data, Research, and Community Participation**
